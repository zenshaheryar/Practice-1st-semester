    "## Introduction\n",
    "### In Python, classes are a fundamental building block for object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to model real-world scenarios. They allow you to create user-defined data structures that encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). This encapsulation promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability."

    "### Constructor: A special method called __init__ that is automatically invoked when an object is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
